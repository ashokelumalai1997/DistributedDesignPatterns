# DistributedDesignPatterns

## Design patterns
In Software Design, there are problems that everyone faces and find solutions to it over time. But since these as said are common, we don't want to re-invent the wheel.
Common language oriented design patterns are classified as Creational, Structural and Behavioural patterns.

Similarly, when it comes to distributed systems, we have its own set of problems. To solve these, experts have already came up with patterns that could solve these challenges

### Most commonly used Distributed Design Patterns

1. Client-Server Pattern

Start with the fundamental client-server architecture as the basis for distributed systems.

2. Load Balancing Pattern

Understand load balancing to ensure even distribution of traffic and scalability.

3. Replication Pattern

Learn how replication enhances fault tolerance and data availability.

4. Partitioning/Sharding Pattern

Explore data partitioning for distributing data and traffic efficiently.

5. Messaging Patterns

Understand how publish-subscribe and message queue patterns enable communication.

6. Service Discovery Pattern

Learn how services discover and communicate with each other in dynamic environments.

7. Database Replication Patterns

Explore master-slave and master-master replication for database scaling.

8. Consistency and Replication Patterns

Understand concepts like eventual consistency and quorum consensus.

9. Caching Pattern

Explore distributed caching to improve performance.

10. Bulkhead Pattern

Learn about isolating components to enhance system resilience.

11. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Understand how to prevent repeated failures from affecting the system.

12. Saga Pattern

Explore transaction management in long-running processes.

13. Eventual Consistency

Delve deeper into the concept of eventual consistency.

14. Quorum Consensus

Understand consensus algorithms for data consistency.

15. Idempotent Pattern

Learn about designing operations that can be retried safely.

16. Versioning and Compatibility Patterns

Understand how to manage backward and forward compatibility.

17. Microservices Patterns

Explore architectural patterns related to microservices.

18. Distributed Tracing and Logging Patterns

Learn about tracking and logging events in distributed systems.

19. Security Patterns

Familiarize yourself with security patterns like authentication and encryption.

20. Chaos Engineering Patterns

Understand strategies for testing system resilience.

21. Streaming Patterns

Explore patterns related to real-time data processing.
